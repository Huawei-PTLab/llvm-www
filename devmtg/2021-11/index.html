<p>The LLVM Developers' Meeting is a bi-annual gathering of the entire LLVM Project community. The conference is organized by the LLVM Foundation and many volunteers within the LLVM community. Developers and users of LLVM, Clang, and related subprojects will enjoy attending interesting talks, impromptu discussions, and networking with the many members of our community. Whether you are a new to the LLVM project or a long time member, there is something for each attendee.
</p>
<p>What can you can expect at an LLVM Developers' Meeting?
<dl>
<dt><b>Technical Talks</b></dt>
<dd>These 20-30 minute talks cover all topics from core infrastructure talks, to project's using LLVM's infrastructure. Attendees will take away technical information that could be pertinent to their project or general interest.</li>
<br></dd>

<dt><b>Tutorials</b></dt>
<dd>Tutorials are 50-60 minute sessions that dive down deep into a technical topic. Expect in depth examples and explanations.</dd>

<dt><b>Lightning Talks</b></dt>
<dd>These are fast 5 minute talks that give you a taste of a project or topic. Attendees will hear a wide range of topics and probably leave wanting to learn more.</dd>

<dt><b>Quick Talks</b></dt>
<dd>Quick 10 minute talks that dive a bit deeper into a topic, but not as deep as a Technical Talk.</dd>

<dt><b>Student Technical Talks</b></dt>
<dd>Graduate or Undergraduate students present their work using LLVM.</dd>

<dt><b>Panels</b></dt>
<dd>Panel sessions are guided discussions about a specific topic. The panel consists of ~3 developers who discuss a topic through prepared questions from a moderator. The audience is also given the opportunity to ask questions of the panel.
</dd>

</p>

<p>What types of people attend?
<ul>
<li>Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella

<li>Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.</li>
<li>Students and Researchers</li>
<li>Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel

<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="cfp">Call for Talk Proposals</div>

<p>
Submit your talk proposals here (but read on as some things have changed):
<a href="https://hotcrp.llvm.org/usllvm2021/">LLVM2021 Submissions</a></p>

This year, we will have a few changes to the program. First, we are introducing a new technical talk category called “Quick Technical Talks”. These talks are similar to full length technical talks or lightning talks except that the speakers are given only 10 minutes. Additionally, we will no longer have a poster session and encourage those interested to submit a lightning talk instead. The Student Research Competition has been modified to no longer be a competition, but a specific category for student presentations and full length papers are not required. Lastly, you will notice that Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions have been removed as a category and we will share plans for these types of sessions at a later date. 

We are looking for the following proposals:
<ul>
<li>Technical Talks (20-25 minutes*):
<br>Talks on:
<ul><li>LLVM Infrastructure,Clang and all related sub-projects</li>
<li>On uses of LLVM in academia or industry</li>
<li>On new projects using Clang or LLVM</li>
</ul>
<li>Tutorials (60 minutes):
In depth talks on LLVM infrastructure or other core libraries, tools, etc. Demos encouraged.
</li>
<li>Student Technical Talks (15-20 minutes*):
Talks from students using LLVM, Clang, and all sub-projects in research. This is no longer a competition and no voting or prizes are involved.
</li>
<li>
Quick Technical Talks (10 minutes): Quick talks about a use or improvement of LLVM and other sub-projects.
</li>
<li>Lightning Talks (5 minutes):
Lightning fast talks about a use or improvement of LLVM and other sub-projects.
</li>
<li>Panels (45 minutes)
Panels may discuss any topic as long as it’s relevant to LLVM or related sub-projects. Panels can take many forms, but a common format is to begin with short introductions from each panel member, and follow with an interactive dialogue among the panelists and audience members. Panels should consist of at least 3 people and have a moderator.
</li>
</ul>
<i>* Exact times TBD after talks selected</i>
<p>
Submission Requirements:
<br>The submission deadline is September 20, 2021 at 5:00PM PDT.
</p>

<p>Please submit your proposal here: <a href="https://hotcrp.llvm.org/usllvm2021/">LLVM2021 Submissions</a>
</p>

<p>For each proposal you must submit the following:
<ul>
<li>Talk title</li>
<li>Abstract</li>
<li>Submission type (Different than last year)</li>
<li>For technical talk submissions, you can indicate if you would give a shorter talk (ie. Lightning or Quick instead of full length Technical Talk)</li>
<li>Photo and bios for all speakers (NEW!)</li>
<li>Short abstract for the website</li>
<li>Extended PDF abstract (optional)</li>
