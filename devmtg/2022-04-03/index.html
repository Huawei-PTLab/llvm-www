<p>
The Sixth LLVM Performance Workshop will be held at CGO 2022
(https://conf.researchr.org/track/cgo-2022/cgo-2022-workshops-and-tutorials). The
workshop is co-located with CC, HPCA, and PPoPP. If you are interested
in attending the workshop, please register at the CGO website
(https://conf.researchr.org/home/cgo-2022). The organizing committee
of CGO/PPoPP/HPCA/CC has decided to make the conference in-person this
year. The LLVM workshop at CGO will have a hybrid model where both
in-person and virtual presentations are welcome.
</p>

<div class="www_sectiontitle">Call for Speakers</div>

<p>
We invite speakers from academia and industry to present their work on the following list of topics (including and not
limited to:)
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Compilation and interpretation techniques benefitting from LLVM,</li>
    <li>Performance optimizations, code-size optimizations and binary instrumentation techniques using LLVM,</li>
    <li>Improvements to runtime libraries developed under llvm-infrastructure e.g., libc++, libc++-abi, OpenMP, etc.</li>
    <li>Improving the security of generated code using compilation techniques,</li>
    <li>Any tools developed with LLVM (or subprojects) for performance analysis,</li>
    <li>compiler flags, annotations and remarks to understand and improve performance,</li>
    <li>any other topic related to improving and maintaining the performance and quality of LLVM generated code.</li>
  </ul>
<p>

While the primary focus of the workshop is on these topics, we welcome
any submission related to the LLVM-project, its sub-projects (clang,
mlir, lldb, Polly, lld, openmp, pstl, compiler-rt, etc.), as well as
their use in industry and academia.
</p>

<p>We are looking for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>keynote speakers(30-60minutes),</li>
  <li>technical presentations: 30 minutes plus questions and discussion,</li>
  <li>tutorials(30-60minutes),</li>
  <li>panels(30-60minutes),</li>
  <li>BOFs(30-60minutes)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Proposals should provide sufficient information for the review
committee to be able to judge the quality of the submission. Proposals
can be submitted under the form of an extended abstract, full paper,
or slides. Accepted presentations can be presented in-person or
online. The presentations will be publicly available on
https://llvm.org/devmtg/, and recordings will be available on llvmâ€™s
youtube channel
(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv2_41bSAa5Y_8BacJUZfjQ)
</p>

<p>
In case of any queries please reach out to the workshop organizers: Johannes
Doerfert (jdoerfert at anl.gov), Aditya Kumar (adityak at snap.com),
Jose M Monsalve Diaz (jmonsalvediaz@anl.gov),
Shilei Tian (i@tianshilei.me),
Vaibhav Kurhe (vaibhav.kurhe@gmail.com)
</p>

<h4>What types of people attend?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella (LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, klee, lld,
    OpenMP, etc).</li>
  <li>Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.</li>
  <li>Students and Researchers.</li>
  <li>Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.</li>
  <li>Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel and interesting ways.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Panels</h4>
Panel sessions are guided discussions about a specific topic. The panel consists of ~3 developers who discuss a topic
through prepared questions from a moderator. The audience is also given the opportunity to ask questions of the panel.

<h4>Birds of a Feather (BoF)</h4>
A BoF session, an informal meeting at conferences, where the attendees group together based on a shared interest and
carry out discussions without any pre-planned agenda.

<h4>Technical Talks</h4>
These 20-30 minute talks cover all topics from core infrastructure talks, to project's using LLVM's infrastructure.
Attendees will take away technical information that could be pertinent to their project or general interest.

<h4>Tutorials</h4>
Tutorials are 30-60 minute sessions that dive down deep into a technical topic. Expect in depth examples and
explanations.
